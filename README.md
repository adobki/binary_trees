# C - Binary Trees

Project completed during **ALX Software Engineering** course. It served as an introduction to binary trees in programming.

## Languages and Technologies Used
* C

## Project Files
The following were written in C, and tested on Ubuntu and/or Windows 11:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `tests`  | Folder. Contains numbered main.c funtions used to compile/test the corresponding numbered project files below. |
| `0-binary_tree_node.c` | Creates a binary tree node. |
| `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c` | Inserts a node as the left child of another binary tree node. |
| `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c` | Inserts a node as the right child of another binary tree node. |
| `3-binary_tree_delete.c` | Deletes an entire binary tree. |
| `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c` | Checks if a node is a leaf. |
| `5-binary_tree_is_root.c` | Checks if a node is a root. |
| `6-binary_tree_preorder.c` | Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal. |
| `7-binary_tree_inorder.c` | Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal. |
| `8-binary_tree_postorder.c` | Goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal. |
| `9-binary_tree_height.c` | Measures the height of a binary tree. |
| `10-binary_tree_depth.c` | Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree. |
